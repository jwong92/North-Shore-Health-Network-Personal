# North Shore Health Network Mock Website

## Description of Project

This is a mock redesign of the existing NSHN website, found (http://www.nshn.care/, here). Over the period of 8 months,
we did a content inventory, a card sort, a variety of responsive wireframes, mockups, and finally design template. This project
in particular was contributed to by 5 individuals, including myself. This repository is dedicated to the features/content that I
worked on myself. For the full project, please see it (https://nshn-hospital.azurewebsites.net/, here).
